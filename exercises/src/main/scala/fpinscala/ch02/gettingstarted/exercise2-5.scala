// EXERCISE 2.5, page 27
// Implement the higher-order function that composes two functions.
// def compose[A,B,C](f: B => C, g: A => B): A => C
// This is such a common thing to want to do that Scalaâ€™s standard library provides

// compose as a method on Function1 (the interface for functions that take one argu ment).
// To compose two functions f and g , we simply say f compose g .

object MyCompose {

  // Input: two parameters
  //   - param1, a function f that takes a B and return a C
  //   - param2, a function g that takes an A and return a B
  // Output: a function that takes an A and returns a C
